        <h2 id="liability-insurance">Liability Insurance Requirements</h2>
        <p> Network security training for all staff is required by the center&rsquo;s liability insurance policy. As specified by our insurance carrier, Universal Pro Inc., each staff member will be assigned to one of three training levels. General users must complete multiple one-hour Level 1 classes to be held onsite at the art center. Department managers will be assigned to a one-day Level 2 training session on basic system administration and security management. The center&rsquo;s two network managers and all technical staff must complete a two-day Level 3 security training seminar at the offices of Brookstone Network Consulting. Level 3 training will be supplemented with ongoing monthly education on emerging network threats.</p>
        <h2 id="instructors">Instructors</h2>
        <p> Brookstone Network Consulting specializes in end-user support, network upgrade project management, and security infrastructure audits. The company&rsquo;s training team combines classroom lectures with hands-on exercises designed to give students immediate, successful experiences with new technologies. Members of the Brookstone training team have won numerous teaching awards and volunteer their time at high schools throughout the St. Louis area.</p>
        <h2 id="training-schedule">Training Schedule</h2>
        <p>The Level 1 training classes will be held in the Orchard View lecture hall. Five laptops will be available for students to share. However, because all software training screens will be projected on the main screen, access to a computer is not required. The training team from Brookstone Networking Consultants will provide the necessary LCD digital projector. The team will need access to the lecture hall one hour before each training session begins.</p>
        <p> The dates for Level 2 and Level 3 training are flexible, as long as all training is completed by the end of June. Network managers are free to set up their department&rsquo;s training dates with the appropriate instructors at Brookstone. Level 1 training will begin in March and continue through the spring. Topics will be covered in the order shown in the following schedule:</p>
