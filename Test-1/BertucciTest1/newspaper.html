        <h2>Getting the News: From Talking Drums to the New York Times</h2>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>Wherever people gather, they want to know what’s going on. That is, they want to know the news. In the modern world, the latest news is just a mouse click away. Hundreds of web sites provide constant updates on the latest events around the world. What’s more, the average person can simply pick up a smart phone and call, text, or email just about anybody else in the world.</p>

        <p>These days, it’s not hard to know what’s going on. But that wasn’t always the case. Before the advent of modern printing, disseminating news to a large audience was difficult. In this paper I will present a brief history of news gathering and distribution, starting with the acta diurna of ancient Rome, and continuing on through contemporary news web sites. Throughout, I hope to illustrate humanity’s ingeniousness when it comes to learning about the world in which we live.</p>

        <h3>Early News Media</h3>
        <p>As at least one historian has observed, the ability to distribute news to a geographically diverse group of people depends on the availability of a reliable medium. But what is a medium exactly? Leona Sanford defines “medium” as a way or a means of accomplishing something. By extension, then, a news medium is a way or means of delivering news to other people.</p>

        <p>Early news media took many forms. In Africa and portions of Asia, a special type of drum known as a talking drum was used. These drums imitated the rhythm of human speech. The use of rising and falling cadences, along with an array of rhythms, allowed drummers to communicate news over vast areas. Typically, a relay system could send a single piece of information as far as twenty miles, with other drummers picking up the message and sending it to villages even further away. Using these drums, it was possible for drummers stationed many miles apart to conduct complex conversations about events of the day.</p>

        <p>In ancient Rome, announcements about political or social events were posted in public places. These announcements, called Acta diurna, were carved in stone or metal and contained information about trials, scandals, political maneuverings, military events and other happenings. They are considered an early form of the modern newspaper.</p>

        <p>Other forms of early news media included town criers, who recited the news in public places, and musicians who travelled from town to town singing ballads about notable political, romantic, and military events.</p>

        <h3>Merchant Newsletters</h3>
        <p>Throughout history, merchants have served as a conduit for news. Letters between merchants and their friends and colleagues in other lands transported information across great distances. In Europe in the medieval era, these newsletters, as they were eventually called, gained great importance. Traders relied on regular newsletters for information about prices, commodities, and the relative safety of trading routes. Newsletters also contained political news and information about prominent families.</p>

        <p>By the beginning of the seventeenth century, a few of these newsletters developed into regular newspapers. Demand for accurate news gathering increased in the century, with weekly publications emerging throughout Western Europe. The Dutch, with their world expansive trade, were the leaders in international coverage. One of the most important Dutch newspapers, News from Italy, Germany, and Elsewhere, began publication in 1618.</p>

        <h3>Modern American Newspapers</h3>
        <p>
            In North America, British law made publishing newspapers difficult if not dangerous. The first attempt, called Publick Occurrences, Both Foreign and Domestick, was meant to be a monthly publication. However, it was shut down by the authorities in 1690 after the first issue. Through the early part of the eighteenth century, official newspapers, published by the government, were widely read. These publications contained proclamations and officially sanctioned news from abroad.
        </p>

        <p>
            The first independent American newspaper, the New-England Courant, began publication in 1721. Owned by Benjamin Franklin’s elder brother, James, the Courant was published in Boston. By the time the American Revolution started, thirty-seven different newspapers published regularly throughout the colonies.
        </p>

        <p>
            Newspapers proved immensely important in the early days of the republic, with political opponents conducting highly charged arguments in the pages of these partisan publications. Over the next century, newspapers became big business, with each technological breakthrough expanding their power to shape public opinion. The most important advance in printing was the advent of automatic typesetting in the 1880s. In the field of communication, telegraphs and telephones made it possible to get the news from Europe and other distant lands instantaneously.

        <h3>Looking to the Future</h3>
        <p>
            Today, the primary media for news is television and the web. At first, newspapers tried to make all their online material available for free, under the assumption that advertisements would keep them in business. However, that business model has not proved practical, and many newspapers have gone out of business over the past ten years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Newspapers like the New York Times have responded by charging for articles accessed via the web. Typically, print subscribers can read the web edition for free. Customers who prefer to read only the online edition can pay for a web subscription. It remains to be seen if this type of arrangement will allow newspapers to thrive, or if the current trend of newspaper closures will continue.
